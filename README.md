# React Native - The Practical Guide

Code created following the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/) created by [Academind](https://www.academind.com/) by [Maximilia Schwarzm√ºller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps)

## Get it running

(**NOTE**: I only have configured and ran it for Android. Extra configuration may be required to run it over iOS)

Cloning this repo and running the following commands should do the trick.

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn run android
```

For more informations about your device + operating system dependencies, take a look at the [official Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page, **React Native CLI Quickstart** tab.
