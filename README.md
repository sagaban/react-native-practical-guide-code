# React Native - The Practical Guide

Code created following the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/) created by [Academind](https://www.academind.com/) by [Maximilia Schwarzm√ºller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps).

Instead of using `React Native Navigation` v1, I went with the v2.

## Get it running

(**NOTE**: I only have configured and ran it for Android. Extra configuration may be required to run it over iOS).

Cloning this repo and running the following commands should do the trick.

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn run android
```

For more informations about your device + operating system dependencies, take a look at the [official Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page, **React Native CLI Quickstart** tab.

## Debugging

To debug the React Native app, install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) and enable *Debug JS Remotely* from the app. Remember to close the browser tab that will be opened.

To debug the Android app itself, just run `react-native log-android` from the terminal.
